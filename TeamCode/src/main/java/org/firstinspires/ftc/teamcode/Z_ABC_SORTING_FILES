Howdy All,

I made this file to share my organization plan to easily find code.
PLEASE GIVE ALL YOUR CODE A USEFUL NAME
Also, put the following caps letter and underscore for each class u create

A_ is for current files for this year
H_ is for common hardware files
T_ is for TEST Classes, co copied programs from FTC opmodes,
    calibration programs, or sensor input tests             OR TEST ROBOTS (STYROBOT)
U_ is for non opmode classes ex vuTime which is a count down timer
W_ is for Practice robots
X_ is for opmodes for old robots
Y_ is for outreach robots
Z_ is for informational files such as this


Also, please DO NOT delete any files that may contain information we might need later on.
